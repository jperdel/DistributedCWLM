# DistributedCWLM
Distributed Spark implementation of the Clusterwise Linear Model.

By running this notebook, you first generate a toy dataset and then execute the experiments with it, including fitting the model, validation of the hyperparameters, and obtaining the performance metrics.

All the necessary code is in the notebook.
